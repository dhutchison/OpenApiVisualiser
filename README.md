## Building for deployment
[This guide](https://angular.io/guide/deployment#deploy-to-github-pages) details how to deploy Angular applications to GitHub pages. 

The package.json defines a "build-deployment" script that can be ran to recompile the project 
in to the "docs" directory. Pushing this directory to master will update the deployed version of the 
application, available at: https://www.devwithimagination.com/OpenApiVisualiser/

This can be ran by running the command:
`npm run-script build-deployment`
